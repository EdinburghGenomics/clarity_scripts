    <br>1) Sample Manifest &#8208; please complete all of the fields in the green columns that are relevant to your samples and return the file to EGCG-Projects@ed.ac.uk. We can only begin processing when both the manifest and samples have been received at Edinburgh Genomics.<br>
    <br>2)	Sample Submission Requirements &#8208; this documents provides guidance on preparing and shipping your samples to Edinburgh Genomics Clinical.<br>
        <br>Please note that we will require the sample(s) to have a concentration of <b>>=50ng/ul</b> at a volume of <b>>= 50 ul</b>.
